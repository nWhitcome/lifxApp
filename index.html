            <p>
                This website is a proof-of-concept for an app I want to create initially with the Spotify API.
                <br><br>
                The idea is that users would sign in with their Spotify account and their Lifx account and the app 
                would change the selected Lifx bulbs to match colors taken from the album cover. The selected colors 
                are shown below the album art and the light groups made in the Lifx app would appear to the right of the art.
                <br><br>
                I want to make this for desktop at first for free but also develop it for Android for free with ads or $1 with no ads.
                It is not meant to replace the Spotify app so it won't have a lot of the same features.
            </p>
