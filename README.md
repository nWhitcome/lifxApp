# Adaptive LIFX with Spotify
This app allows users to log in with Spotify, where it takes the album art of the song that is currently being listened to.
It grabs a batch of colors from that art and assigns them to LIFX bulbs. It also uses the Spotify API's analysis to change each bulb's intensity with the music.

This program is very early in development and has a number of bugs. It currently requires hard-coding in the LIFX group that is used. Fixing this is the first priority.
